# Machine Learning Algorithms with Different Models
 Machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest, KNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Bernoulli and Gaussian Naive Bayes with different datasets. PCA, LDA and GridSearch algorithms also included for all models.
# Visualization
 For every model, various visualizations such as confusion matrix, tree, class distributions, etc. are supported
# Datasets
 Churn, Drug, TeleCust, Ä°ris and Cell Samples datasets are included for the model. Visualizations are belongs to the Cell_Samples dataset. For other datasets, all scaling and data-processing processes competed and ready to use.
