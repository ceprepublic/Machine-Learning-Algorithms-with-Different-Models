# Machine Learning Algorithms with Different Models
 Machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest, KNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Bernoulli and Gaussian Naive Bayes with different datasets. PCA, LDA and GridSearch algorithms also included for all models.
# Visualization
 For every model, various visualizations such as confusion matrix, tree, class distributions, etc. are supported
# Datasets
 Churn, Drug, TeleCust, Ä°ris and Cell Samples datasets are included for the model. Visualizations are belongs to the Cell_Samples dataset. For other datasets, all scaling and data-processing processes competed and ready to use.
# How to run?
 You can just download this repo and run the Project.ipynb file, you must be careful about the other functions with .py extension must be in the same folder with the .ipynb file.
 # Warnings
  1) For Decision Tree model, to plot the tree, you must adjust the parameters according to the outputs which we found with GridSearch manually. 
  2) For Bernoulli Naive Bayes normal function, I get zero-division error but I couldn't find a solution for this problem.
  3) For Logistic Regression normal function, when I adjust the dictionary parameters like in the code, there is converge problem but it gives a solutions anyway.
